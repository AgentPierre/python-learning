# Practice Exercises

**Note:** This repo focuses on AI-native, problem-first learning. For traditional structured exercises, we recommend:

## Recommended External Resources

### Free Practice Platforms
- **freeCodeCamp** - [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/)  
  Structured exercises with automated tests
  
- **Automate the Boring Stuff** - [Free online book](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)  
  Practice problems at end of each chapter

- **Python.org Tutorial** - [Official docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)  
  Interactive examples you can try

### When to Use This vs AI-Native Approach

**Use external exercises when:**
- You want structured, incremental practice
- You prefer traditional learning style
- You're building syntax muscle memory

**Use this repo's `problem_solving/` when:**
- You want to build real tools
- You want to learn AI collaboration
- You want projects for your portfolio

## Alternative: Build Your Own Exercises

Instead of following exercises, try this AI-native approach:

1. Pick a concept from `python_concepts/mental_models/`
2. Ask AI: "Give me a small problem that uses [concept]"
3. Solve it with AI collaboration
4. Complete the understanding checkpoint
5. Document what you learned

**This builds problem-solving skills, not just syntax recall.**
- Try multiple approaches to the same problem
- Refer back to these when starting projects
