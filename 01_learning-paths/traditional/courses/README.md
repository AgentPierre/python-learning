## How This Repo Complements Courses

**Traditional Course → This Repo Workflow:**

1. **Learn concepts** from course (variables, loops, functions, etc.)
2. **Come to this repo** when ready to build something real
3. **Use `problem_solving/`** to tackle real-world challenges
4. **Apply AI collaboration** to build faster
5. **Use understanding checkpoints** to ensure you actually learned

**Example:**
- Complete freeCodeCamp chapters 1-8 (Python basics)
- Build Downloads Organizer from `problem_solving/real_world_challenges/`
- Use what you learned from the course + AI to build it
- Document your understanding in `projects/01_downloads_organizer/understanding/`

## Why Not Duplicate Course Content Here?

**Focus:** This repo's unique value is teaching you to:
- Solve problems (not memorize syntax)
- Collaborate with AI (not vibe code)
- Build understanding (not just ship code)
- Retain knowledge (come back after months)

**Traditional courses already do syntax/structure incredibly well.** We recommend them instead of duplicating that effort.

**Our focus:** What happens AFTER you know basics — building real things with AI assistance while maintaining deep understanding.
