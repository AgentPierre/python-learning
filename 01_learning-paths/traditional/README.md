## 📖 Weekly Workflow

### Monday-Tuesday: Learn (2-3 hours)
1. **Study course materials**
   - Watch videos / read tutorials
   - Run example code yourself
   - Take notes in `notes/weekXX_[topic].md`

2. **Experiment**
   - Modify examples to see what happens
   - Ask "what if...?" questions
   - Break things intentionally to learn

---

### Wednesday-Thursday: Practice (2-4 hours)
1. **Complete exercises**
   - Work through `exercises/` for current week
   - Don't just copy solutions - understand them
   - Create variations of exercises

2. **Review concepts**
   - Reread your notes
   - Clarify anything confusing
   - Look up additional resources if needed

---

### Friday: Build (1-2 hours)
1. **Apply to projects**
   - Work on current project in `../../projects/`
   - Use concepts from this week
   - Start simple, iterate to improve

2. **Reflect and plan**
   - Update your notes with insights
   - What was hard? What clicked?
   - Preview next week's topics

---

### Weekend: Optional (0-5 hours)
- Get ahead on next week
- Build something fun
- Or rest and let concepts settle!

**Consistency > intensity. Daily practice beats weekend cramming.**

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. Take Good Notes
Your `notes/` folder is crucial for retention. Use this template:

```markdown
# Week X: [Topic]

## Topics Covered:
- Concept 1
- Concept 2

## Key Takeaways:
[What really stuck with you?]

## Code Examples:
[Working examples you can reference later]

## Challenges & Solutions:
[What was hard and how you figured it out]

## Next Week Preview:
[What's coming up]
```

---

### 2. Don't Rush
- Speed doesn't matter
- Understanding matters
- Better to deeply learn one thing than superficially learn ten

---

### 3. Type Code, Don't Copy
- Physically typing code builds muscle memory
- Even if you're following a tutorial, type it yourself
- Make small modifications to test understanding

---

### 4. Practice Active Recall
After learning a concept:
- Close the tutorial
- Try to write code from memory
- If you can't, that's your signal to study more

---

### 5. Build Alongside Learning
Don't wait until "ready" to build projects:
- Start Downloads Organizer in Week 2
- Build imperfect versions first
- Improve as you learn more

---

## 🔗 Integration with AI-Native Path

**You can switch or combine paths!**

### When to Add AI-Native Elements:
