# Problem Solving Foundations

> **Master the core skill: Breaking down problems so AI can solve them**

Welcome to the problem-solving section. This is where you learn the art of turning real-world chaos into clear, solvable problems.

---

## 🎯 What You'll Learn Here

Before you use AI to build anything, you need to know how to:

1. **Define problems clearly** - What exactly are you trying to solve?
2. **Break down complexity** - What are the core pieces?
3. **Identify constraints** - What can't you do?
4. **Set success criteria** - How do you know you're done?

**Why this matters:** Vague problems = vague solutions. Clear problems = excellent solutions.

## 📚 Learning Sequence

### Step 1: Learn Thinking Frameworks (1-2 hours)
**What:** How to break down any problem  
**Materials:** [Problem-Solving Frameworks](thinking_frameworks/README.md)

**You'll learn:**
- The Problem Definition Canvas
- How to identify core features vs nice-to-haves
- Common pitfalls when defining problems
- Real examples from actual projects

**Practice:** Work through the frameworks with 2-3 problems before starting projects.

---

### Step 2: Study Real-World Challenges (30 minutes)
**What:** See how actual problems are defined  
**Materials:** [Real-World Challenges](real_world_challenges/)

**Examples include:**
- Organizing downloads automatically
- Tracking personal expenses
- Building a web scraper
- Generating professional PDFs

**Why:** See how professional-grade problems are structured and decomposed.

---

### Step 3: Apply to Your Projects
Once you understand the frameworks, you'll:
1. Clearly define each project problem
2. Break it down into solvable pieces
3. Collaborate with AI to build the solution
4. Review and understand every line of code

## 🔑 Core Concepts

### The AI-Native Problem-Solving Workflow

```
1. Understand the Problem
   ├─ Current state
   ├─ Desired state
   ├─ Success criteria
   └─ Constraints

2. Break It Down
   ├─ Core features
   ├─ Nice-to-haves
   ├─ Edge cases
   └─ Dependencies

3. Create a Plan
   ├─ Step-by-step tasks
   ├─ Data flow
   ├─ Integration points
   └─ Testing strategy

4. Direct AI
   ├─ Give AI the full context
   ├─ Ask for specific components
   ├─ Review each piece
   └─ Iterate on improvements
```

## 💡 Quick Reference

### The Problem Definition Canvas

Before diving into ANY project, fill this out (takes 15 minutes):

```markdown
# [Project Name]

## Current State
(What's the problem right now?)

## Desired State
(What success looks like)

## Success Criteria
(How you'll know it works)

## Constraints
(What you CAN'T do)

## Core Features
(What absolutely must work)

## Nice-to-Haves
(What would be cool but isn't essential)

## Edge Cases
(What could go wrong?)
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Read:** [Thinking Frameworks](thinking_frameworks/README.md) (1-2 hours)
2. **Study:** [Real-World Challenges](real_world_challenges/) (30 mins)
3. **Go to:** [AI Collaboration Guide](../../04_guides/ai_collaboration/prompting_mastery/README.md) to learn how to ask AI the right questions
4. **Build:** Pick your first project and apply these frameworks

## 📖 Understanding the Full Learning Path

This is **Phase 1** of the AI-native learning path:
- ✅ **Phase 1: Problem Solving** (You are here)
- ⏭️ **Phase 2: AI Collaboration** - Learn effective prompting and code review
- ⏭️ **Phase 3: Build Real Projects** - Solve actual problems with AI
- ⏭️ **Phase 4: Master Concepts** - Deep dive into Python fundamentals

**Your mission:** By the end of Phase 1, you should be able to take any real-world problem and clearly articulate it in a way AI can solve.
