#  Start Here

Welcome to your Python learning repository!

##  The AI-Native Learning System (2026 Edition)

This repository focuses on learning Python through **AI collaboration** and **real problem-solving**. Instead of traditional syntax drills, you'll solve actual problems while learning to work effectively with AI tools like Cursor, Copilot, and Claude.

**That's the unique value here.** For traditional courses (freeCodeCamp, Automate the Boring Stuff), see [README.md](README.md).

##  Quick Start

1. **Setup:** [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) - Install Python, Git, and optional AI tools (15 minutes)
2. **Read:** [README.md](README.md) - Understand the repository and choose your learning path (5 min)
3. **Choose:** Pick your path below and get started

##  Your Learning Path

### ⭐ AI-Native Path (Recommended for 2026)
**Best for:** Anyone wanting to learn Python in the modern way.
- Solve real problems from day 1  
- Learn AI collaboration skills (actually use Cursor, Claude, Copilot)
- Build genuine projects for your portfolio
- Anti-vibe-coding: understand what you build

**→ [Start AI-Native Path](01_learning-paths/ai-native/problem_solving/README.md)**

---

### 📚 Traditional Path (External Resources)
**Best for:** Prefer structured tutorials without AI assistance.

We recommend proven external resources instead of duplicating their work:
- [freeCodeCamp - Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) (free)
- [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) (free)

**After basics, come back here to build real projects with AI.**

---

### 🔄 Hybrid Path
**Best for:** Want both approaches.
1. Start with freeCodeCamp/Automate the Boring Stuff for fundamentals
2. Use this repo's `problem_solving/` to build real projects
3. Apply AI techniques as you build
