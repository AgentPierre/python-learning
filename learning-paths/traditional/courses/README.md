# Course Materials

Code and projects directly from structured courses.

## Active Courses

### freeCodeCamp Python Course
- **Link**: [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/)
- **Structure**: Follow-along code organized by course sections
- **Location**: `freecodecamp/`

### Automate the Boring Stuff with Python
- **Link**: [Book Website](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
- **Structure**: Chapter-based projects and exercises
- **Location**: `automate_the_boring_stuff/`

## Organization

Each course has:
- Subfolders matching the course structure (sections/chapters)
- Code files that follow along with lessons
- Practice problems from the course
- Small projects or assignments

## Usage Tips

1. **Name files descriptively**: `password_validator.py` not `exercise3.py`
2. **Add comments**: Explain what each section does
3. **Keep it organized**: One folder per chapter/section
4. **Link to lessons**: Add comments with the lesson URL

## Difference from `exercises/`

- **`courses/`**: Specific to course curriculum, follow-along code
- **`exercises/`**: General practice, not tied to a specific course
