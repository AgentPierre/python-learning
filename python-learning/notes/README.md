# Learning Notes

This folder contains weekly notes and topic summaries from my Python learning journey.

## Organization

- **Weekly notes**: Chronological learning journal (e.g., `week01_basics.md`)
- **Topic notes**: Deep dives into specific concepts
- **resources.md**: Bookmarked links, articles, and helpful resources

## Note-Taking Strategy

Each weekly note includes:
- Key concepts learned
- Code snippets and examples
- Challenges encountered and solutions
- Questions for further exploration
- Links to related exercises or projects

## Tips for Effective Notes

- Write notes in your own words (don't just copy)
- Include practical examples
- Link to relevant code in `exercises/` or `courses/`
- Review notes at the start of each week
